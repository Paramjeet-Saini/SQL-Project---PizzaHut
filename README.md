# SQL-Project---PizzaHut
Using SQL to analyze and extract insights related to revenue and orders within a given dataset and answering related questions. 
-----------------------------
This project focuses on leveraging SQL to analyze and extract insights related to revenue and orders within a given dataset. By querying the data effectively, we aim to uncover trends, patterns, and key performance indicators that inform decision-making processes. The primary objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of revenue generation, order fulfillment, and customer behavior, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to enhance business performance and optimize strategies for growth.
