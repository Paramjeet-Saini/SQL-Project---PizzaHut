Using SQL to analyze and extract insights related to revenue and orders within a given dataset and answering related questions.

This project focuses on leveraging SQL to analyze and extract insights related to revenue and orders within a given dataset. By querying the data effectively, we aim to uncover trends, patterns, and key performance indicators that inform decision-making processes. The primary objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of revenue generation, order fulfillment, and customer behavior, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to enhance business performance and optimize strategies for growth.

## IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER !
- I have created 'VIEW AS' Query fro all the answers,
- So if you want to run the query for answers use___  " SELECT * FROM ANSWER'X' "
- WHERE X IS THE CORRESPONDING NUMBER OF THE QUESTION. Eg. ANSWER1, ANSWER2.
